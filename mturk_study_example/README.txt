This folder contains an example of a complete experiment run online on MTurk by Ruth Shaffer. This experiment was created using JsPsych libraries and documentation (version 5.0.3; Copyright 2015 Joshua R. de Leeuw). The experiment incorporates several features that are often needed for online data collection:

1. Checking for subject browser (Chrome / Mozilla)
2. Consenting in an external html form (via html plugin)
3. Obtaining and checking MTurk ID
4. Creating stimuli / html formatting
5. Online response scoring
6. Time stamps (UTC)
7. Final demographic and other questions we typically ask on MTurk
8. Some plugins I’ve changed (formatting/data logging/presentation changes)
	- any plugin with RAS in it means it’s a modified jsPsych plugin
	- so it may differ from online documentation
9. Note that the css has been altered (although I left name as is)
