  <h4 id="consentH4">We invite you to participate in a research study being conducted by investigators from Washington University in St. Louis.  The purpose of the study is to better understand the processes that contribute to long-term learning and memory.  The James S. McDonnell Foundation is funding this research study.  
</h4>
  <h4 id="consentH4">If you agree to participate, we would like you to study words, word-pairs, educationally-relevant text, or images.  We will then ask you to restudy and take tests on some of the material again at various times.  The entire study will take between 30 minutes and 2 hours, and we may ask that you complete the study in one sitting or across multiple days.  If you do not wish to participate in the study at any point, you may stop participating by simply letting the experimenter know that you do not want to participate or closing the website page.  We may re-contact you by email up to three times before a given session to remind you of the impending experiment session. Approximately 1000 people will take part in this study at Washington University.</h4>
  <h4 id="consentH4">There are no known risks from being in this study, and you will not benefit personally.  However we hope that others may benefit in the future from what we learn as a result of this study.</h4>
  <h4 id="consentH4">You will not have any costs for being in this research study.</h4>
  <h4 id="consentH4">You will be paid for being in this research study. You will need to provide your social security number (SSN) in order for us to pay you. If your social security number is obtained for payment purposes only, it will not be retained for research purposes. You may also need to provide your address if a check will be mailed to you.  Mailed checks should take no longer than 3 to 4 weeks to arrive.  You will be paid $5.00 per half-hour of participation in this study.  On average, this study will take 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete (which corresponds to $5.00 to $10.00 payment).  If you complete this study in multiple visits, you will be paid or given course credit for the full amount of time you spent participating in the study.  If you withdraw from the study prior to completing all components of the study, you will be compensated for the amount of time you spent participating.  You may choose to receive course credit instead of monetary payment.  You will receive 0.5 course credits per half-hour of participating in the experiment, and, as with monetary compensation, will receive course credit for the full amount of time you spend participating in the study. </h4>
  <h4 id="consentH4">MTurk participants will receive approximately $4.50 per half-hour of participation.  If a participant completes the experiment in multiple sessions, the pay across all sessions together will approximate $4.50 per half-hour of participation; however, the pay may begin at a lower rate for earlier sessions and rise to a higher rate for later sessions.  If a participant withdraws from the study before it's completion, the participant will be compensated for the total advertised amount of the completed session(s).  This advertised amount may approximate a rate lower than $4.50 per half-hour for earlier of multiple sessions.</h4>
  <h4 id="consentH4">We will keep the information you provide confidential by storing your experimental data in association with an ID code number given to you or your MTurk ID, rather than your name.  This data will be stored electronically on a password-protected computer or server in a lockable office.  For non-MTurk participants, a sheet of paper connecting your initials to your ID code number will be stored in a binder in a lockable cabinet in a lockable office suite.  However, federal regulatory agencies and Washington University, including the Washington University Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews and approves research studies) and the Human Research Protection Office may inspect and copy records pertaining to this research.  If we write a report about this study we will do so in such a way that you cannot be identified.</h4>
  <h4 id="consentH4">Your participation in this study is completely voluntary.  You may choose not to take part at all.  If you decide to participate in the study you may stop participating at any time. Any data that was collected as part of this study will remain as part of the study records and cannot be removed.  If you decide not to take part in the study or if you stop participating at any time, you wonâ€™t be penalized or lose any benefits for which you otherwise qualify. </h4>
  <h4 id="consentH4">If you do not wish to participate in this study or want to end your participation in the study, simply notify the experimenter that you would like to stop participating or close out of the experiment webpage.  You will not be penalized or lose any benefits for which you otherwise qualify.</h4>
